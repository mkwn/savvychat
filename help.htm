<title>SavvyChat - Help</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre id="aliaslist" style="display:none;">{{ aliaslist|escape }}</pre>
<h1>Help</h1>
<p>SavvyChat is designed to combine the functions of email, IRC and IM. New messages will automatically be delivered to everyone, but the chat is persistent over multiple sessions like email. SavvyChat is equally suitable for sending an essay or the word &quot;lol&quot;.</p>
<p>You can include SavvyChat into GMail or iGoogle by adding the gadget <span class="code">http://{{ netloc }}/gadget.xml</span>. You may first need to enable adding gadgets by URL in GMail Labs. Note that this is a rough work in progress and does not work in a variety of circumstances.</p>
<p>Authentication is done with your Google account. There is a whitelist of accounts that I'm allowing to view and use SavvyChat.</p>
<p>Basic usage should be self-explanatory. There are a number of special codes that can be used for formatting and such, and most are designed to look as natural as possible even before being parsed.
<ul class="spaced">
<li><span class="code">I am **very** angry</span> renders as &quot;I am <strong>very</strong> angry&quot;</li>
<li><span class="code">Nice //ad hominem//, bro</span> renders as &quot;Nice <em>ad hominem</em>, bro&quot;</li>
<li><span class="code">I __love__ hate you</span> renders as &quot;I <span class="strikethrough">love</span> hate you&quot;</li>
<li>Text within <span class="code">`</span> tags (backtick, underneath your esc key) does not have formatting applied and is displayed as-is in a fixed-width font (for displaying computer code or an ASCII diagram). If you actually want to type a backtick, you can do this with a double backtick.<br />Example: <span class="code">```I am **very** angry```</span> renders as &quot;<span class="code">`I am **very** angry`</span>&quot;</li>
<li>You can also typeset math in TeX: <span class="code">$<a></a>$e=mc^2$<a></a>$</span> renders as &quot;\(e=mc^2\)&quot;. Math can take some time to render on slower computers.</li>
<li>You can make a bulleted list by prefixing each line of the list with <span class="code">-&nbsp;</span> (that's hyphen-space)</li>
<li>You can quote someone by starting a line with <span class="code">&gt;</span> (click the quote button next to someone's post for an example). If the first line of a quote is <span class="code">&gt;!label</span>, then the quote becomes collapsible (you can use this for spoilers)</li>
<li>Although most objects that look like a link are automatically turned into one, you can specify a link by enclosing the URL in <span class="code">[[double square brackets]]</span>. You can give it a label like this: <span class="code">[[label@@url.com]]</span></li>
<li>You can include an image in your post with the code <span class="code">[[img@@url.com]].</span></li>
</ul>

Keyboard shortcuts include ctrl+b for bold, ctrl+i for italics and ctrl+q for quote.</p>

<p>You have the ability to address your post to specific people by including the code <span class="code">@name</span>. The post will appear red for them, and if their window doesn't have focus, they will hear a tone (even if they have turned the alert tone off, unless they are using the <span class="code">/mute</span> option). If they are not online, an email will be sent to them.</p>Here are the valid aliases for the existing users (case insensitive):

<ul>
<script type="text/javascript">
var aliases=[]
var aliasesData=$("#aliaslist").text().split("\n");
for(var alias in aliasesData){
	aliasData = aliasesData[alias].split(" ");
	aliases.push({aliastext:aliasData[0],meaning:aliasData[1]});
}
for (var j=0;j<100;j++){
	if(aliases.length==0) break;
	var meaning = aliases[0].meaning;
	var theseAliases = [];
	for(var i=aliases.length-1;i>=0;i--){
		if(aliases[i].meaning == meaning){
			theseAliases.push(aliases[i].aliastext);
			console.log(aliases[i].aliastext)
			aliases.splice(i,1);
		}
	}
	theseAliases.reverse();
	var meaningText = "";
	if(meaning.indexOf(",")!=-1)
		meaningText = ": "+meaning
			.replace(/,/g,", ")
			.replace(/\w[^, ]*/g,function(txt){return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase();});
	document.write("<li>@"+theseAliases.join("/@")+meaningText+"</li>");
}
</script></ul></p>

<p>Finally, here's the list of commands. Just type these into the compose box.
<ul>
<li><span class="code">/preview</span>: show or hide the blue preview bar</li>
<li><span class="code">/hf</span>: show or hide the header and footer</li>
<li><span class="code">/shift</span>: reverse the functionality of ENTER and SHIFT+ENTER</li>
<li><span class="code">/tone</span>: enable or disable the alert tone</li>
<li><span class="code">/help</span>: show this help window</li>
<li><span class="code">/math</span>: enable or disable live math preview. This does <em>not</em> disable math altogether, its purpose is to ease CPU load on slower computers.</li>
<li><span class="code">/mute</span>: mute or unmute all sounds, including the ringing tone when called.</li>
<li><span class="code">/sync</span>: if there was some kind of connection problem and you failed to receive some messages, this command will synchronize the discussion.</li>
<li><span class="code">/ping</span>: this command is mostly for my use, it tests whether your connection is active without the need to send a message.</li>
<!--<li><span class="code">|refresh</span>: if for some reason your connection seems to have failed without raising an error, this command will refresh your token, reopening a channel.</li>-->
<li><span class="code">/upload</span>: open the file/image upload dialog. The size limit is just under 1MB. There is not yet an upload progress bar, so be patient after you click the upload button.</li>
<li><span class="code">/logout</span>: Log out of your Google Account and SavvyChat.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In the very likely case that you find a bug or something fails catastrophically, please gather as much information as you can (a screen capture, a debug message, some source code etc) and describe the problem to me so I can fix it. I'd also appreciate feature requests. You can see what I've got already <a href="todo.txt">here</a></p>
