PRIORITY 0: DEFECTS
in gadget mode, too tall, cant seem to change it
tony can't scroll the savvychat window on his phone
opens multiple refresh dialogs when post fails to send
in IE7 ping check apparently fails
call abort() when an error page is returned
set icon before page load?
sometimes i get connection error without timeout refresh
consider implications of deadline error
james is getting freezes on math load
ping function to check whether connection is active, especially after disconnect
flushtokens
add notify confirm for some commands
I had an issue where the preview text was not inline with the authortext in the label
gadget not working for damien
onbeforeunload not firing in gadget mode
when file is too large, error should be returned
perhaps i should put file upload on a different server
what if comet is really slow and sync finishes first? then therell be duplicates
math in spoilers is bold for some reason, seems to be because of display:none and autobold
math is using image fonts in gadget
ben has an opaque id for old posts
limit topic length
sync periodically - sometimes stuff doesn't send
fix timezones in dump
notify shouldn't join to non-notify

PRIORITY 1: IMPORTANT
allow manual resize of gadget
autoresize tall pictures
notify who you are calling
multiple profiles
dynamic aliases in help
store filename with files
can't really see grey on black background for gadget
themes
	clean up themes code
	add to options
	add to doc
	add ui
dont send mails to yourself, but send a special confirmation that can be filtered

authenticate more stuff
call/title in one command
email a log every day?
autoparse parentheses like (http://a)
if message is long, preview less frequently to avoid lag
clean up calls
allow call for arbitrary email
clean up long message sending
email "from" field should be more descriptive like kwan@savvychat.appspot.com
perhaps can use hidden form and iframe to avoid needing to deal with long messages
time out all requests
make "this" refer to the <a> with javascript links
|status with average latency and connection expiry
nested dot points
give some context instead of only showing unread
store icon binary in javascript http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/24430
color code names
clicking on a name should do something, maybe call?
|flushtokens
gmail gadget
	authentication with openID
		seems necessary to open popup
		fiddle with security settings
	google accounts authentication
		gadget double signin http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/apps-apis/thread?tid=42cc7b7de291bdd5&hl=en
	when open full view, disable the version of savvychat in the gadget
		when it closes bring the gadget version back
	when gadget is minimized, disable
	dynamic resizing with |+ and |-
x minutes ago/x seconds ago for dates
press up in empty textbox to get last message
queue posts with verify instead of disabling send

PRIORITY 2: COMPLICATED
recognize and collapse conversations
write a real parser
allow to invite guest
post color/display pictures - more easily identify poster
search archive
multiple threads
edit/retract posts
customize size/layout of elements
	columns
sending a mail to savvychat mailer forwards the mail to savvychat
	escape backticks so can put email in code block
option to display online status
iphone/android app
	cache messages
image draw
"like" button
some kind of private message system
different nicer skins

PRIORITY 3: OPTIMIZATIONS
probably dont need to send ?u
maybe ?t should be optional
math shouldnt need to rerender
use keys for chatusers instead of filtering and get()ing
implement memcache for token list
	implement memcache flush command
maybe I should periodically send a refresher so resolvestragglers is more accurate than 2 hours
replace instances of charcodeAt()+1 with "\r" after stripping them
have base.css and gadgets.css
	
PRIORITY 4: NIGGLING THINGS
tony had an issue where his tab font turned red occasionally
mathjax is being strange with stuff that happens just as the page loads, empty $$$$ is a hacky fix
stumbleupon and such break the window alignment
|tag| is annoying to type
i've overloaded //// so you can't use it to type a backtick just before a code block
