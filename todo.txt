PRIORITY 0: DEFECTS
i keep getting connection error instead of resent token
I had an issue where the preview text was not inline with the authortext in the label
limit topic length
secure each url to prevent impersonation etc.
time out all requests and verify that sent posts are recieved
clean up long message sending

PRIORITY 1: IMPORTANT
allow javascript: links without adding http://
store icon binary in javascript
color code names
dot points/numbered points
hidden blockquote for spoilers
clicking on a name should do something, maybe call?
|flushtokens
gmail gadget
	authentication with openID

		fiddle with security settings
	google accounts authentication
		gadget double signin http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/apps-apis/thread?tid=42cc7b7de291bdd5&hl=en
	when open full view, disable the version of savvychat in the gadget
		when it closes bring the gadget version back
	when gadget is minimized, disable
	dynamic resizing with |+ and |-
x minutes ago/x seconds ago for dates
format call emails a little better
press up in empty textbox to get last message

PRIORITY 2: COMPLICATED
allow to invite guest
post color/display pictures - more easily identify poster
search archive
multiple threads
edit/retract posts
customize size/layout of elements
	columns
sending a mail to savvychat mailer forwards the mail to savvychat
	escape backticks so can put email in code block
option to display online status
iphone/android app
	cache messages
file/image upload
image draw
"like" button
some kind of private message system
different nicer skins

PRIORITY 3: OPTIMIZATIONS
probably dont need to send ?u
maybe ?t should be optional
math shouldnt need to rerender
use keys for chatusers instead of filtering and get()ing
implement memcache for token list
	implement memcache flush command
maybe I should periodically send a refresher so resolvestragglers is more accurate than 2 hours
replace instances of charcodeAt()+1 with "\r" after stripping them
have base.css and gadgets.css
	
PRIORITY 4: NIGGLING THINGS
