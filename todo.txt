IMMEDIATE
limit topic length
resend token on expiry
	as well as the token, all posts in the downtime should be resent (use cursor)

	split into multiple messages with special metadata so client knows to join
	in the meantime, give a warning and don't clear the field
secure to prevent impersonation etc.
autosend messages that happen between page load and onopen (use cursor)
call should have a special tone
logoff should close token
|flushtokens
|sync for when messages fail
time out all requests and verify that sent posts are recieved
periodically send a refresher so resolvestragglers is more accurate than 2 hours
|tag| is annoying to type
autoquoting an action fails
don't merge messages that have a really long gap
