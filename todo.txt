duplicate tokens are being created, probably because duplicate MainPage is called before OpenPage
call should have a special tone
time out all requests and verify that sent posts are recieved
clean up long message sending

PRIORITY 1: IMPORTANT

PRIORITY 3: OPTIMIZATIONS

math shouldnt need to rerender
use keys for chatusers instead of filtering and get()ing
there is a dedicated emailproperty
implement memcache for token list
	implement memcache flush command
